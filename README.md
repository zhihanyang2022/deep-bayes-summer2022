# Slides on Bayesian + Deep Learning

- Week 1: an overview of Bayesian deep learning, summarizing Part 1 and 3 of 2020 ICML tutorial on Bayesian deep learning by Andrew Wilson
  - Lingering questions:
    - Relationship between generalization, inductive bias, marginal likelihood and bias-and-variance
    - How to interpret MC dropout?
- Week 2: deep ensembles as approximate Bayesian inference
  - Very interesting perspective alongside MCMC and deterministic methods (e.g., variational inference)
- Week 3: weight uncertainty in neural networks
  - Fully factorized approximate posterior obtained via variational inference
  - Connection to Thompson Sampling for contextual multi-armed bandit
